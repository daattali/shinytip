data-balloon-visible (maybe support onclick using that? add a javascript listener that adds/removes this tooltip?)

circle with question mark icon that has tooltip

try rmd

try modules

try insertUI and uiOutput

Balloon.css make use of pseudo-elements thus self-closing elements such as <img>, <input> and <hr> will not render tooltips. (for img place it in a div)

Also keep in mind that if pseudo elements are already in use on an element, the tooltip will conflict with them resulting in potential bugs.


tippy doesn't work with insertUI
